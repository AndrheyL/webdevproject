            Zombies are living humans infected with the Green Flu virus, which causes massive growth
            <br />
            in aggression and the loss of many higher brain functions such as speech and conscience.
            <br />
            The Green Flu Virus can also cause several mutations in which they are call special infected.

            <p class="survtext">
                The Tank is the largest and most powerful of the Infected, The Tank is
                <br />
                extremely tough, slowing only when hit with a massive volume of automatic
                <br />
                weapons fire. The Tank has extraordinary strength and resistance,
                <br />
                flinging concrete chunks ripped from the earth.

            <p class="survtext">
                When provoked, the Witch is extremely powerful, capable of incapacitating
                <br />
                and even killing Survivors with a single blow. It is agile, capable of
                <br />
                outrunning a survivor if provoked. It is best to stay quiet and avoid close
                <br />
                proximity, as staying close will provoke her.

            <p class="survtext">
                The Boomer spews a distinct bile at Survivors, briefly blinding them and
                <br />
                attracting a swarm of Common Infected to them. When they die, they burst,
                <br />
                covering any nearby Survivors with bile. At long range, the Boomer isn't
                <br />
                much of a threat; just one solid bullet to it's bloated body and it will die.

            <p class="survtext">
                The Smoker's fairly long tongue can suffocate Survivors. Smokers, as the
                <br />
                name implies, produce smoke when killed in order to obstruct Survivors'
                <br />
                visibility. The Smoker may use his tongue to drag players towards
                <br />
                themselves, but he remains stationary and therefore cannot move.

            <p class="survtext">
                The Hunter is very quick and nimble, capable of scaling walls in seconds.
                <br />
                He can also pounce and pin down Survivors, tearing through their abdomens
                <br />
                until the victim dies or the Hunter is pushed off or killed by another
                <br />
                Survivor.

            <p class="survtext">
                The Spitter shoots a green ball of acid from a great distance, which when
                <br />
                it hits the ground expands into a massive puddle and severely injuring any
                <br />
                Survivors that come into contact with it. The longer the Survivor remains
                <br />
                inside it, the more damage the ooze causes.

            <p class="survtext">
                The Charger rushes, crashing into the Survivors. If he succeeds, he will take
                <br />
                and carry a single Survivor while pushing and knocking the others down. Once
                <br />
                the Charger hits a wall or other obstacle, or runs a certain distance, he will
                <br />
                start slamming the survivor into the ground to death until an ally frees them.

            <p class="survtext">
                The Jockey assaults survivors by clinging to them from behind and riding them
                <br />
                while attacking. He can shift his weight around and force the Survivor to fall
                <br />
                in the direction he wants, giving it some control over the Survivor. He will 
                <br />
                only let go if his victim is rendered unconscious or if he is knocked off/killed.
