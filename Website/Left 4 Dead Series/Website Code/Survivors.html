                Bill ran out of wars after two traumatic missions in Vietnam, one of several
                <br />
                medals, a knee full of shrapnel, and an honorable discharge. Bill has
                <br />
                reclaimed the only thing he's ever wanted: an enemy to fight, after decades
                <br />
                of pointless drifting and dead-end jobs when the pandemic hits.

            <p class="survtext">
                Francis acts like the zombie apocalypse is the world's biggest bar brawl,
                <br />
                cocky, boisterous, and very confident he's indestructible. When the virus
                <br />
                struck, everyone else began stockpiling supplies and looking for a safe
                <br />
                haven. Francis discovered a rifle and had a good time with it.

                <br />
                spending her first semester watching zombie films. Now that the planet
                <br />
                has been overrun by murderous zombies and all of her professors have died,
                <br />
                Zoey can accept the fact that she was studying the right subject after all.

                Analyst in his company's IT department when a virus struck, shattering the
                <br />
                world. Hopefully, he'll figure out how the new management works before

                they have a chance to kill him.

                Coach has a big heart, a nutritious appetite, and a nasty chainsaw swing.

                Working as a defensive coordinator for the freshmen tour team may not have
                <br />
                been the best path to a professional coaching career, but it has known to be
                <br />
                highly useful in guiding a group of Survivors to safety.

                Nick has learned two valuable lessons from a lifetime of drifting from city to
                <br />
                city, and trying to stay out of jail: don't trust anyone, and keep an eye on
                <br />
                number one. Now he's thrown together with three strangers that goes against
                <br />
                all of his instincts. But if he wants to survive, he'll have to learn to trust them.

                <br />
                she'll give up her dream job anytime soon. Surviving a zombie apocalypse is
                <br />
                just another thing she can use her wits and determination to accomplish.

                <br />
                ruin it. The zombie apocalypse turns out to be yet another big dare, and there's
                <br />
                no lack of crazy things he can do to impress his new friends.
